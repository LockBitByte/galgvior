hello
Are you ready to negotiate?
to decrypt the data and avoid publication you need to pay us. we haven't published your name on our blog yet
Price decrypt 3 000 000$
we wait your answer and your offers
Also keep in mind that we have stolen your data and can publish it at any time
We offer you to decrypt all your files as well as files of your hypervisors for 1 million
You are a fairly large company and it will not be a problem for you to collect such an amount
It's up to you to pay or not, we also backed up your SQL databases before overwriting and encrypting them so they're safe
ur offer is that you make a payment of exactly $ 1,000,000 and we give you a full set of decoders for both ESXi and the Windows family
we will soon send you a tree of stolen data
If you don't pay, the files from the tree will be published. we don't care how you feel about them
