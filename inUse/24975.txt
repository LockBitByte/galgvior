⚡ **THE WRATH OF ODIN IS UPON YOU** ⚡

Your data has been cast into the halls of Valhalla, encrypted beyond mortal comprehension. Only the wisdom of Odin can restore what has been lost.

To unlock your files and bring balance to your digital realm, you must pay tribute to the Allfather.

1. **Tribute (3 BTC)**: Send payment to this Bitcoin address:
   BTC Address: 1OdinFuryAsgardian12vRagnarok456

2. **After the payment is confirmed**, your files will be released from their prison in the afterlife.

---

You have **48 hours** to comply, or your data will be sent to the eternal void of Niflheim, never to return.

**Do not attempt to defy the gods**. Tampering with the encrypted files will summon the wrath of Odin himself, and your data will be lost forever.

To pay tribute and restore your files, contact us at: valhalla@protonmail.com

**Fate has been decided, mortal. Will you defy the gods or surrender your treasure?**
