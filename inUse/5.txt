ðŸ”¥ **SURTUR'S FLAME CONSUMES YOUR DATA** ðŸ”¥

Your files have been scorched by the fire demon Surtur, who wields the flames of Muspelheim. Your data now lies in ashes, and only by appeasing the fire lord can it be reborn.

**Pay 6 BTC** to resurrect your files from the fire.

**How to pay**:
1. Transfer 6 BTC to this address:
   BTC: 1SurturFlame1234Ragnarok567

2. Send proof of payment to: muspelheim-fire@protonmail.com

---

If the payment is not made in **48 hours**, the fires of Muspelheim will consume all your data, leaving nothing but ashes. Attempting to extinguish the flames without our help will result in permanent destruction.

---

**Your fate is sealed. Will you rise from the ashes, or will you burn in the fires of Surtur?**
